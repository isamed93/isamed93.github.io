                                <p>To some, personalisation means getting the right recommendations on Spotify. For others, personalisation means getting a unique experience in a spa treatment. A third group might think it means getting relevant ads shown to them.</p>
                                <p>All of these have one thing in common - data is being used to tweak the product or service for the user. The quantity and depth of this data may change from application to application: Spotify is checking your play history and liked songs, Youtube is looking at your search and play history, the spa is asking you for your preferences in a form, websites are tracking your cookies, AI assistants (like <a href="https://reclaim.ai/">Reclaim</a>) take your calendar, working hours, habits and tasks to help you organise your daily routine, etc.</p>
                                <p>Some of those applications will seem more amenable than others depending on the user <i>- if I wanted my daily life managed I'd hire my mum for free, thank you very much -</i> and this judgement boils down to how much data we are giving the application and the risk of data breach weighed against the benefit we get out of the product or service.</p>
                                <p>This alone isn't too bad, letting people choose how they want their data used and whether they find it worth it is subjective and likely to change over time. However, there are some major concerns with regards to (a) users actually being informed of how much of their data is being collected, (b) information overload causing users to get fatigue from constantly having to check and (c) the safety of their personal information in the face of data breaches. Golbeck et al.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> explored user perception of data privacy within their Facebook app and found that users were generally under-informed about how much data is being collected and used. Milne et al.<a href="#ref2">[2]</a> evaluated the readability of privacy notices over time and found that they have become longer and harder to read as time went on.</p>
                                <p>Ensuring that people's data is secure and respected benefits more than just the user - the more trust people have in a system and its handling of privacy, the more likely they are to engage with it. Tucker et al.<a href="#ref3">[3]</a> analysed the effectiveness of personalised ads with user-posted personal information vs generic text. Even though there was no change in how advertisers used data to target and personalise ads, when users perceived to be more in control over their privacy they were twice as likely to engage on those ads.</p>
                                <p>This brings me to my next point: in my opinion, government intervention is necessary to make sure that our systems both are and seem trustworthy. In other words, give users more control over their data and privacy and make sure that they feel in control of their data and privacy. Self-regulation in this space wouldn't work as there is a high risk of implementations that simply make users feel safe but not actually deliver on privacy and safety. This would then inevitably result in a breach that breaks users' trust in the system and it would be really hard to recover from that.</p>
                                <p>All in all, personalised products and services have the potential to provide a lot of benefit to users since you can account for their specific needs and preferences but said assistance requires personal information. It is imperative for these applications to ensure the safety of this data as well as relinquishing control of it to the user (collection, usage and deletion).</p>
                                <p>So, what can we do as users to protect ourselves from privacy invasions? What can we do as a society to protect users? In other words, how can we do better? These are the questions we should answer sooner rather than later as data-driven technology advances.</p>
